## fallow

An experimental messaging framework, designed for elegant and efficient communication.

### Why Fallow?

- **Flexible**: Supports Redis and NATS out of the box.
- **Agnostic**: Use JSON, MsgPack, or plug in your own.
- **Built on [Wisp](https://github.com/vanqure/wisp)**: Minimal, high-performance event bus powering Fallowâ€™s internals.
- **Simple & Expressive**: Clean annotations and subscribers, no boilerplate.

### Get started
